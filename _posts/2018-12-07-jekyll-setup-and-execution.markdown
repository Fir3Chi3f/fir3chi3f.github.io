I've been in need to have a place to write my thoughts down for quite some time. I had a few fails with Wordpress years 
ago, then OctoberCMS, then Pelican, but here we are with Jekyll.

The funny thing is, my first programming language was Ruby and I was attempting OctoberCMS because I was working
when I worked for a company that used PHP and now I'm with a company which uses Ruby. 

I want to delve into these topic further, but remaining on topic of the new blog -
I followed the instructions given by github to a point via their [post on the subject][github-article]. Thing of it is,
the gh-pages gem requires an older version of Jekyll which I decided against using. Something about using the latest 
version just really gives me the warm and fuzzies.

I guess we'll see how long this blog setup lives.
